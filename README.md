# Math Shodown ‚öîÔ∏è

A turn-based combat game where your math skills determine the winner! Heavily inspired by the classic fighting game *Samurai Shodown*, this project was created for a **Computer Programming 2** activity to demonstrate event-driven programming, animation through timers, and game state management in VB.NET.
